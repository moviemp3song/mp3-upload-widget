Feature requests
Please follow the bug guidelines above for feature requests, i.e. update to the latest version and search for exising issues before posting a new request.

Generally, feature requests might be accepted if the implementation would benefit a broader use case or the project could be considered incomplete without that feature.

Pull requests
Pull requests are welcome and the preferred way of accepting code contributions.

However, if you add a server-side upload handler implementation for another framework, please continue to maintain this version in your own fork without sending a pull request. You are welcome to add a link and possibly documentation about your implementation to the Wiki.

Please follow these guidelines before sending a pull request:
